START_MESSAGE = "Hi, I'm Cardano Rewards Notification Bot.

<pre>/getrewards &lt;Address for rewards&gt;</pre>

I can also automatically notify you about the stacking awards, use this command to do this

<pre>/subscriberewards &lt;Address for rewards&gt;</pre>

and I'll let you know when the next awards arrives to your address. If you suddenly change your mind about receiving notifications, you can always unsubscribe from it, use this command to do this

<pre>/unsubscriberewards &lt;Address for rewards&gt;</pre>

* Please note: An rewards address is a special address with prefix \"addr1\" and 64 characters long, which is different from your regular wallet address. If you don't know it, use the command

HELP_MESSAGE = "An rewards address is a special address with prefix \"addr1\" and 64 characters long, which is different from your regular wallet address. If you don't know it but you know mnemonic (15 words), you can get the address from the console Cardano-Wallet and Jormungandr. To do this, you need to download from here <a>https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet/releases</a> latest release of  Cardano-Wallet-Jormungandr for your system, uncompress it, and then run the following commands:

<pre>cardano-wallet mnemonic reward-credentials</pre>

after that you will need to enter 15 words of mnemonics, and press Enter 2 times. In response, the system will show a private key that begins with ed25519e_sk.... After that, run the second command

<pre>echo ed25519e_sk1.... | jcli key to-public</pre>

which will show the public key that begins with ed25519_pk1... And finally, the last command

<pre>jcli address account --testing --prefix addr ed25519_pk1.....</pre>

show you the address you need. It should be used.

I can also show it to you in a pinch, but <b>it is strongly not recommended, for security reasons</b>. If you still want to do it use this command
